                    <h1>Brief History of Siaton</h1>
                    <p>The legend of Siaton goes to the days before the Spaniards came to the Philippines. Long before that it is said that there was a small settlement situated between two rivers now Siaton and Canaway rivers. The original natives were said to have descended from the one of the ten families that left Borneo with Datu Puti. Following the oral accounts, it was said that a deaf man lived by the big river west of the balangay. It was him that several Moro traders met as they scouted for drinking water. Being hard of hearing, they answered their queries with his name, “Si Aton”, thinking that they were asking what his name was. From then on, the place was called SIATON.
                    </p>
                    <p>The earliest settlement of the town was located at Bokoboko near the old cemetery at the mouth of the Canaway River. But due to incessant piratical raids, the residents were forced to transfer to Olambid (presently in sitio Nawacat in Casala-an). In 1777, the resident elected Apak as their leader. Eventually, the drying up of the river where the Moros used to dock their boats motivated the resident to move lower to Mangudkod (Barangay Sandulot). Spanish missionaries subsequently asked them to move further down to Calumpang under Eskong Yawa and by 1872, they finally settled in the present Poblacion.
                    </p>
                    <p>From then on, the municipality will share its historical development with other areas in the province punctuated with highlights of disasters and events within the general framework of Philippine history. In essence the history of the municipality would evolve around the political administra-tions of the subsequent leaders that ruled the town especially the political influence and control of the Tayko Family from the Spanish period up to 1996 when finally the populace elected an “outsider” from the traditional ruling elite family.</p>
                    <p>The Siaton Parish was instituted in 1848, under the patronage of St. Nicholas de Bari. The fiesta highlight is a ritual of pagan provenance, the Inagta, featuring dark-painted performers imitating the movements of certain wildlife.</p>
                    <p>The Bonbonon range, which has undergone massive greening, supplements the town's economy with vast sugarcane plantations and agro-forestry.</p>
                    <p>Barrio Casala-an was the seat of the 6th District Civil Government during World War II. In Bonbonon Point, also referred to by the natives as Pirate's Cove, was the site of the PC Coastal Patrol's first calamity on February 7, 1942, when their boat was shelled and sunk by a Japanese destroyer.</p>
