                        <p>There is only one word to describe this place <span>&#8211</span> breathtaking! 40 kilometers south of  Dumaguete City, Antulang Beach Resort lies suspended on a ten sprawling hectares of sheer cliffs. Their swimming pools and premium rooms are positioned right on the cliff<span>&#x27</span>s edge, ensuring guests a commanding view of an endless sea. The winding staircases lead directly to a kilometer<span>&#x27</span>s stretch of isolated white sand beach strewn with large, natural rock formations.</p>

                        <p>Location: Salag, Siaton, Negros Oriental</p>
                        <p>Hidden Beach in Siaton is a pristine pocket of coastline just over an hour<span>&#x27</span>s drive from Dumaguete City. We stumbled upon this little gem as we drove aimlessly along the coast in search of the best beaches near Dumaguete to hang out just the two of us. Tucked away at the bottom of the cliff, this white sandy beach is dotted with giant boulders and tropical trees so we could lay a towel down in the shade. It might not be the biggest beach we<span>&#x27</span>ve been to, but it was nice to have the place all to ourselves for an afternoon of sunbathing and swimming.</p>

                        <p>Location: In front of Si-it, Siaton, Negros Oriental</p>
                        <p>The Turtle Island, located about 15 kilometres from the Siaton Municipal Plaza, has one of the best beaches in the Municipality. It can be reached via a habal-habal ride and then a short boat ride. The Turtle Island of Siaton got its name because of the turtles that hatch at a certain area during their season. The sands of the island are characterized with fine white sand on the other side and rough rocks on the other (during low tide).</p>
